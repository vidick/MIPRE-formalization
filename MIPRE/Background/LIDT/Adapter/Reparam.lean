# The seeded-CL adapter, part 2: affine reparametrization of a line answer

Both tests answer a line question with a univariate polynomial in *the parameter of the line*,
and they parametrize the same line differently: the base points differ by a multiple of the
direction and the directions differ by a scalar (see
`MIPRE.Background.LIDT.Adapter.Geometry`, and the correction in
`planning/lidt-cl-adapter.md`). So converting an answer means substituting an affine map
`t ↦ a t + b` into the polynomial — the "canonicalization and rebasing" of
`rem:lidt-cl-adapter`.

Answers are coefficient vectors (`LinePoly F k = Fin (k+1) → F`), and the substitution has to
preserve the degree bound exactly, since the bound *is* the answer alphabet: an adapter that
raised the degree would not be producing an answer of the canonical-line test at all.

Doing this directly on coefficient vectors means a Taylor shift, hence the binomial theorem by
hand. Going through `Polynomial F` avoids that entirely: `toPoly` and `ofPoly` are mutually
inverse between coefficient vectors and polynomials of degree at most `k`
(`ofPoly_toPoly`, `toPoly_ofPoly`), `natDegree_comp_le` gives the degree bound for free, and
the inverse substitution is the composition with the inverse affine map, so the
reparametrization is a bijection with no computation on coefficients at all.
