# Preliminary comparison theorems: projective converse

Projective-case converse of `prop:simeq-to-approx`. This lemma lives in a
sibling module to `ComparisonCore` because its proof uses
`projSubMeas_diagMass_eq_mass`, which is introduced in
`SwitchSandwichPrep.Core`, downstream of `ComparisonCore`.

The imports above are chosen to make the direct dependencies explicit rather
than relying on transitive re-exports through `SwitchSandwichPrep.Core`:
`ComparisonCore` is the sibling comparison module, `ConsistencyBridges`
supplies the `BipartiteSDDRel`/`ConsRel` bridging machinery, and
`SwitchSandwichPrep.Core` provides `projSubMeas_diagMass_eq_mass`.
