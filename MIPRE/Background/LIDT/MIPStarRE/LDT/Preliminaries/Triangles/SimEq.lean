/-- `prop:simeq-triangle-inequality`.

Apply `simeqToApprox` to the two hypotheses through the middle
measurement `B`, use the `SDDRel` triangle inequality to compare the induced
right-side families, and finish with `triangleSub`. Quantitatively this gives
`ε + sqrt (4 * (δ + γ)) = ε + 2 * sqrt (δ + γ)`.

This is stated here with the exact paper-style API needed by downstream files. -/

/-- Heterogeneous form of `prop:simeq-triangle-inequality`.

This is the paper's triangle step for a general bipartite strategy: the first
and third measurements act on Alice's space, while the second and fourth act on
Bob's space.  No same-space identification or swap symmetry is used. -/

/-- `prop:triangle-inequality-for-approx_delta`.

The paper states the iterated telescoping version for an arbitrary chain of
approximations. The current API records the binary composition step used
throughout the repository; the full iterated form follows by induction on the
length of the chain. -/
