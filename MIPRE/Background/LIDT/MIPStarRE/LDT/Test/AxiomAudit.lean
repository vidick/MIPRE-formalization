# Axiom audits for classical low-individual-degree soundness

Regression checks for the issue-#408 replacement of the former ambient
Polishchuk--Spielman axiom by the explicit hypothesis
`PolishchukSpielmanClassicalSoundnessStatement`.

The audits for
`MakingMeasurementsProjective.orthonormalizationCompletionRoute` and
`MakingMeasurementsProjective.orthonormalization` require the standard Lean
axioms only: the locality-preserving repair theorem in
`MakingMeasurementsProjective/LocalityPreservingRepair.lean` has been discharged for both the
documented completion-route construction and the paper-facing
`100\zeta^{1/4}` theorem.

The audit for `MakingMeasurementsProjective.orthonormalizationMainLemma`
requires the standard Lean axioms only: the source-facing
`84\zeta^{1/4}` measurement orthogonalization lemma is proved from the
left-lifted projectivization repair and no longer has any hidden repair input.
The source rounding-to-projectors proposition `projectiveNonMeasurement` and
its constructive theorem
`projectiveNonMeasurement_of_sourceAlmostProjective_full` are also checked
not to import `sorryAx`; the latter is the formal construction linked from
`\label{lem:projective-non-measurement}`, not an additional hypothesis of that
source lemma.

The audit for the full Naimark theorem separates the Lean statement of the
paper's projective-submeasurement tensor correlation theorem from the checked
questionwise interface.  The theorem
`MakingMeasurementsProjective.oneMeasNaimark` and
`MakingMeasurementsProjective.naimarkTensorProductCorrelation` are now
axiom-clean: the one-measurement theorem is proved by the finite-dimensional
isometry-extension construction, and the four-register trace identity
`OneMeasNaimarkData.twoSidedCorrelationPreservation` has been discharged from
the checked one-measurement compression identity.  The theorem
`MakingMeasurementsProjective.questionwiseNaimark` remains a separate
axiom-clean Lean-only interface entry.

The audit for `SelfImprovement.selfImprovement` requires the standard Lean axioms
only: the issue-#1230 SDP slackness dependency has been discharged by the
canonical finite-dimensional SDP strong-duality argument.

The audit also checks the full selection-dependent `lem:add-in-u`
formalization.  The structure `SelfImprovement.AddInUFullStatement` records the
paper's universally quantified transfer inequality, while
`SelfImprovement.addInUFullStatement_of_isGood` constructs it from the standing
good-strategy hypotheses by using the selected Cauchy--Schwarz chain and the
global-variance estimate.  The reduced `addInU` lemma remains only a downstream
specialization.

The audit for `Test.mainFormal` records that the current two-space, corrected
large-`k` interface has no connection, residual, repair, data, or obligation
hypotheses.  The large-`k` and `k > 0` scalar-cascade boundary is documented in
`docs/paper-gaps/issue-906-main-formal-k-bound.tex` and
`docs/paper-gaps/issue-422-main-formal-zero-k-boundary.tex`.  Its proof routes
through the heterogeneous role-register symmetrization and the checked theorem
`MainInductionStep.mainInduction`.

The base case of the induction theorem is proved by `mainInductionBaseCase`,
while the arbitrary non-base branch merely decomposes the parameters and invokes
the native successor-step theorem `mainInductionSuccessorNext`, whose nontrivial
branch is the named construction theorem
`mainInductionSuccessorNext_ofSmallErrorConstruction`.  That ordinary successor
theorem now has no direct `sorry`; it calls the internal simultaneous
answer-valued induction theorem `MainInductionStep.answerMainInduction`.  The
answer-valued pasting theorem
`MainInductionStep.answerLdPastingInInductionSectionOfSmallError` is now a
checked reduction through discharged answer-valued estimates:
`answerComMainForCarrier_ofAnswerGood`, the proved
`answerLdPastingInInductionSectionDegreeZeroOfSmallError`, and the proved
`answerLdPastingInInductionError_le_mainInductionError_of_smallError`.  The
predecessor answer-valued induction argument is supplied inside
`MainInductionStep.answerMainInduction`, not asserted as a standalone theorem
hypothesis.  The former degree-zero family branch has been removed from the
active frontier because the predecessor induction hypothesis no longer assumes
`0 < d`; in the nontrivial branch, `1 ≤ k` is derived from
`mainInductionError < 1`.  The
answer-valued self-improvement data are constructed by the
standard-axiom-clean carrier route.  The answer-valued base case
`MainInductionStep.answerMainInductionBaseCase` is standard-axiom clean, using
the same one-dimensional axis-parallel-line construction as the ordinary base
case.  The answer-valued large-error branch
`MainInductionStep.answerMainInductionOfOneLeError` is also standard-axiom
clean, using the same distinguished trivial polynomial measurement as the
ordinary large-error branch.  The answer-valued successor slice theorem
`MainInductionStep.answerSuccessorRestrictedSliceConclusions` now performs the
local recursive application to every restricted slice once the predecessor
answer-valued induction hypothesis is in scope.  Thus the former transitive
`sorryAx` dependency has been removed from the current `mainFormal` path.  The
final theorem proves the saturated-error branch, while its small-error branch
calls the checked role-register scalar-boundary theorem under the corrected
nonzero sampling hypothesis.  The zero-sampling boundary tracked by #422 is
removed from the source theorem statement by the explicit hypothesis `0 < k`.

The audit for `GlobalVariance.globalVarianceOfPoints` now requires the standard
Lean axioms only: the issue-#1456 six-step local transport estimate is supplied
by `GlobalVariance.localVarianceTransportChainBound`, so the paper-facing theorem
no longer carries a `sorryAx` dependency.

The audit for `MainInductionStep.selfImprovementInInductionSection` records
standard Lean axioms only: the measurement-valued realization of
`thm:self-improvement-in-induction-section` no longer inherits any issue-#1230
SDP slackness proof debt.

The audit for `MainInductionStep.mainInduction` records that the corrected
large-`k` Lean interface to `thm:main-induction` is now proved.  The
source-labelled blueprint theorem uses the same corrected hypothesis
`k ≥ 400 m d`.  The scalar side-condition discrepancy is recorded in
`docs/paper-gaps/issue-906-main-formal-k-bound.tex` as a confirmed statement
gap in the printed theorem statement.

The audit for
`MainInductionStep.mainInductionSuccessorNext_ofSmallErrorConstruction` records
that the small-error successor construction for the native Section 6 step is
now standard-axiom clean.  The
public successor theorem `MainInductionStep.mainInductionSuccessorNext` calls it
only after splitting off the already proved large-error branch.  This theorem
is now proved from the internal answer-valued induction theorem
`MainInductionStep.answerMainInduction` and the checked answer-carrier
successor reduction.  The direct `sorryAx` site is no longer the ordinary
successor theorem, nor the answer-valued successor corollary; the answer-valued
pasting theorem is also proved by the answer-valued commutativity route.  The
degree-zero branch and scalar absorption have been discharged.
The predecessor induction argument is supplied by the strong-induction proof
of `MainInductionStep.answerMainInduction`.  The checked reduction
`MainInductionStep.answerMainInductionSuccessorNext_ofRecursiveHypothesisAndAnswerPasting`
reduces the successor branch to the answer-valued pasting theorem
`MainInductionStep.answerLdPastingInInductionSectionOfSmallError`, which is now
standard-axiom clean.
The transitive audit also records the exact downstream Section 6 handoff:
`mainInductionSuccessor` and `mainInduction` are standard-axiom clean.

The answer-carrier reductions
`MainInductionStep.mainInductionSuccessorNext_ofAnswerCarrier`,
`MainInductionStep.mainInductionSuccessorNext_ofAnswerCarrierFromSuccessorBound`
are also standard-axiom clean.  They are not paper theorems; they are internal
successor reductions from the predecessor answer-valued induction hypothesis.
They remove the answer-valued slice-transport input from the active successor
route: the needed self-improvement data are constructed directly from
`AnswerSelfImprovementData.ofAnswerCarrier`, and the successor-bound form derives
the predecessor large-`k` side condition from the successor large-`k` hypothesis.
The answer-valued recursive slice restriction
`MainInductionStep.xRestrictedAnswerSymStratOfAnswer` and its
restricted-probability theorem
`MainInductionStep.answerSuccessorRestrictedProbabilities` are also
standard-axiom clean; they are constructions toward the simultaneous
answer-valued induction argument, not added hypotheses of the paper theorem.
The named stage-data constructors used by these reductions are also checked not
to import `sorryAx`; they are bookkeeping and transport constructions, not
hidden proof assumptions for the paper theorem.

The Section 3 final-theorem witness constructors have the same separation.
Base-case role witnesses, the successor-dependent role witness, and
projective-completion transport are standard-axiom clean.  They are constructed
from the corrected induction theorem and do not introduce added final-theorem
witness hypotheses.

The audit for `Pasting.ldPasting` now requires the standard Lean axioms only:
the unrestricted paper-facing theorem no longer depends on a dedicated
degree-zero `sorryAx`, because issue #1622 has been discharged by the direct
degree-zero construction in `Pasting/Bernoulli/Final.lean`.

The audits for `CommutativityPoints.commutativityPoints`,
`Commutativity.commDataProcessedG`, and `Commutativity.comMain` require the
standard Lean axioms only.  The boundedness data consumed by the latter two
is the formal record for the boundedness witnesses `Z^x` appearing explicitly
in `references/ldt-paper/commutativity-G.tex`; it is not an additional bridge
or residual hypothesis.

The audit for `ExpansionHypercubeGraph.laplacianSpectralGapOrdered` now
requires the standard Lean axioms only: the ordered-eigenvalue statement of
`cor:laplacian-spectral-gap` is proved by connecting the Fourier
diagonalization to the ordered roots of the characteristic polynomial, so the
former issue-#1497 `sorryAx` dependency is gone.

The axiom expectation is attached to each declaration separately.  The current
paper-facing route is audited with the standard Lean axioms only; if a future
declaration is temporarily audited with a larger expected set, its status must
be justified at that declaration rather than inferred from nearby checks.

The audit for the helper strong self-consistency assembly now requires the
standard Lean axioms only: the issue-#1514 local estimate is proved by the
`HelperSSC` chain.  The audit for `SelfImprovement.selfImprovementHelper` also
requires the standard Lean axioms only: the issue-#1230 SDP slackness dependency
has been discharged.

The audit for `SelfImprovement.sdp_statement_with_slackness` requires the
standard Lean axioms only.  The theorem states and proves the SDP strong-duality
and complementary-slackness conclusion of `lem:sdp` from the canonical
finite-dimensional semidefinite-programming argument.  The same audit covers
the abstract slackness structures, the matrix-level slackness statement, the
canonical-to-abstract extraction theorem, and the displayed measurement witness
used by the helper proof.

The audit for
`Test.TwoProverClassicalLIDStrategy.lowIndividualDegreeAcceptanceProbability_eq_branchAverage`
requires the standard Lean axioms only.  It is the definitional branch-average
calculation for the displayed low-individual-degree test figure.

The blueprint-linked auxiliary declarations whose names contain words such as
`Input`, `Repair`, `Residual`, `Package`, `Hypotheses`, `Obligations`, `Bridge`,
`Producer`, `Statement`, `Slackness`, or `Dominance` are all covered by explicit
assertions in this file.  These names are not by themselves proof defects: some
are direct encodings of paper hypotheses, some are construction theorems, and
some are auxiliary comparison statements.  The audit records whether each checked
declaration uses only the standard Lean axioms, has exactly the expected Section
6 dependency when explicitly documented, or does not itself import `sorryAx`.

This module is built explicitly in CI rather than imported from the umbrella
library modules, so the axiom audits stay out of normal downstream imports
while still acting as regression tests.
