# Average lemmas for finite-support distributions

This module contains the finite-sum and uniform-average lemmas for the project
`Distribution` type.  The primitive distribution definitions, uniform
distributions, and total variation distance live in
`MIPStarRE.LDT.Basic.Distribution`.

## Main declarations

The main results are the algebraic rules for `avgOver`, scalar and
operator-valued forms of the module-valued finite-sum rules for uniform
distributions, and the comparison between finite uniform averages and Mathlib
uniform probability mass functions.

## References

These are formalization-internal finite probability lemmas for the low
individual degree test development.
