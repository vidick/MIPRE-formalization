# Local `avgOver` congruence tactic

This opt-in proof helper peels equality goals headed by the project-local
`MIPStarRE.LDT.avgOver` by first trying `avgOver_congr`, introducing the averaged
variable, and recursing through nested averages.  When a `using` tactic asks it
to close the leaf and the plain route cannot do so, it backtracks to the
support-restricted theorem `avgOver_congr_on_support`, introduces both the
averaged variable and its support membership hypothesis, and retries the same
leaf logic.  At non-average leaves it tries an optional user-supplied tactic
first, then `rfl` and `simp`, and finally leaves an unclosed leaf goal for the
following tactic only after at least one average has been peeled.

Usage patterns:

* `avg_congr` recursively descends through `avgOver` goals and closes definitional
  or simplifiable leaves.
* `avg_congr with x, u` names the introduced average variables before leaving the
  final leaf goal; the comma-separated `with` list is variadic.
* `avg_congr using tac` additionally tries `tac` at every leaf before the default
  closers; placeholders such as `_` are often enough when the introduced variables
  need not be named.  If the plain pointwise route does not close, the tactic
  retries with `avgOver_congr_on_support`, so `tac` may use the introduced support
  membership hypothesis; with `x` it is named `hx` when that name is available,
  and it can always be found by type with `by assumption` or `‹_›`.

The tactic is intentionally conservative: it registers no global simp rules and
first tries the existing `avgOver_congr` theorem.  With a `using` tactic, the
support-restricted theorem `avgOver_congr_on_support` is used only as a
backtracking fallback when the plain route cannot close the resulting leaf.
