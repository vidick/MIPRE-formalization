-- After extracting the pointwise normalization helpers above, the final
-- four-term assembly proof elaborates within the default heartbeat budget.
/-- Internal form of `lem:commutativity-switcheroo` after applying
`lem:g-complete-self-consistency`.

**Source:** The proof in `references/ldt-paper/ld-pasting.tex:560-706` uses
the complete-part self-consistency conclusion internally.  The paper-facing
theorem `commutativitySwitcheroo` below derives it from the source strong
self-consistency hypothesis rather than exposing it as a public hypothesis. -/

  Paper reference: `lem:commutativity-switcheroo` in
  `references/ldt-paper/ld-pasting.tex`.
  This is the main aggregate-commutation step upgrading commutation with each
  `G^x_g` to commutation with the total `G^x`.

  The paper informally compares all four `qSDDOp` expansion terms to a single
  scalar center. In Lean it is cleaner to use two centers whose contributions
  cancel algebraically:

  * `G ⊗ M` for the first/third terms
  * `M ⊗ G` for the second/fourth terms

  This avoids inserting an extra symmetry assumption on `ψbi` at this stage.
