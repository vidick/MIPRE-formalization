# Deciders and normal form verifiers

Blueprint `def:decider`, `def:normal-verifier` and `def:lambda-bounded` (paper `games.tex`,
Definitions `def:decider`, `def:normal-ver`, `def:normal-game`, `def:lambda`; ledger node
`1.1.3`). A normal form verifier is the uniform way the pipeline presents an infinite family
of games: a sampler (`MIPRE.CL.Sampler`), which produces the questions, and a decider, which
checks the answers, both programs of the ambient cost model (`MIPRE.Cost`).

* `MIPRE.Decider`: a program whose one input is `encode (n, x, y, a, b)`; it *accepts* when it
  halts with output `1` (`Decider.Accepts`), and rejects otherwise.
  `Decider.TimeBoundAt n T k` is `TIME_𝒟(n) ≤ T`, read as halting within cost
  `T · (|d| + 1)^k` on every input `(n, d)`, well formed or not: the paper's bound is uniform
  over all inputs, which the ambient model cannot achieve (see below), so the running time is
  bounded by a polynomial in the size of the input whose coefficient is `T` and whose degree
  is `k`.
* `MIPRE.Verifier ℓ`: a sampler and a decider, with the paper's requirement that the decider
  accept only questions of the sampler's dimension `s(n)` (it "first checks
  `|x| = |y| = s(n)`", `Verifier.accepts_length`).
* `Verifier.game n T`: the game `𝒱_n` — questions `𝔽₂^{s(n)}`, answers the bit strings of
  length at most `T` (`Verifier.Answers T`), the sampler's distribution, and acceptance by the
  decider. The paper's `𝒱_n` is the case `T = TIME_𝒟(n)`; the bound is a parameter here
  because every statement about `𝒱_n` carries an explicit time bound anyway, and taking the
  exact supremum would only add a degenerate case (`TIME_𝒟(n) = ∞`, where the paper's game is
  undefined) to every definition. `Verifier.syncGame` is the same game as a
  `SynchronousGame`, under the condition on the decider that makes it one
  (`Verifier.IsSynchronousAt`).
* `Verifier.IsBounded λ`: `def:lambda-bounded`, `TIME_𝒮(n), TIME_𝒟(n) ≤ n^λ` with degree `λ`
  in the input size, and `s(n) ≤ n^λ`, for `n ≥ 2`, and `|𝒱| ≤ λ`.

Timeouts are not modelled: in the ambient cost model a decider with `TIME_𝒟(n) < ∞` halts on
every input of index `n`, and the paper's convention that a timeout is a rejection is the
convention that anything but halting with output `1` is.

## Why the time bound is a polynomial in the input size

The paper's `TIME_𝒟(n)` is the maximum of the running time over *all* inputs of index `n`,
finite because a Turing machine can stop reading after a bounded prefix. The ambient model
has no cursor into its input: a value is inspected in place by `elim`, one node per step, but
a loop can carry the rest of a list from one iteration to the next only by copying it
(`Eval.var` costs the size of the value), so walking `j` cells of a list of size `s` costs
about `j · s`, and no program can check `|x| = s(n)` for unbounded `s(n)` within a cost
independent of `|x|`. A bound uniform over all inputs is therefore satisfiable only by
deciders that never look past a fixed depth of their input — none that satisfies
`Verifier.accepts_length` with `s(n) → ∞`.

The degree `k` is needed as well as the coefficient `T`, and this is forced by the one thing
every decider of the pipeline does: run another program through the universal machine. The
overhead of `MIPRE.Cost.UniversalMachine` is a polynomial `Q` in `|c| + |v| + t`, of degree
well above one (`Cost.Universal.univPoly`), so a simulated run costing `T · (|d| + 1)^k`
becomes one costing about `Q(T · (|d| + 1)^k)`, of degree `k · deg Q` in the input size. No
fixed degree is closed under the composition the deciders perform; a *bounded* degree is, and
`k` is that bound. Taking one parameter for both — `T · (|d| + 1)^T` — would be closed too,
but then `λ`-boundedness would read as degree `n^λ` in the input size, which is not a
polynomial-time condition at all and would make `MIPRE.GapCompression` assume compression of
verifiers the paper's proof cannot compress.

So `TimeBoundAt n T k` is "cost at most `T · (|d| + 1)^k`", and `λ`-boundedness bounds both
parameters by `λ`'s: coefficient `n^λ`, degree `λ`. The consequence `s(n) ≤ TIME_𝒮(n)` of the
paper, which depended on the uniform bound, is put into `IsBounded` as a clause.

/-- **`λ`-boundedness forces `2 ≤ λ`**, through the size clause: every program encodes to a
`Data.cons`, so `2 ≤ |𝒟| ≤ |𝒱| ≤ λ` (`Cost.Prog.two_le_esize`).

This is small and entirely load-bearing. The time clauses of `IsBounded` are all guarded by
`2 ≤ n`, so at `n = 0, 1` they say nothing and no budget exists — acceptance at those indices
is genuinely `Σ₁`. What rules those indices out is not an extra hypothesis anywhere but this
lemma: a verifier that is `n`-bounded is so at an `n` that is at least `2`. **If the
`V.size ≤ lam` clause is ever dropped from `IsBounded`, `MIPRE.Halting.accOf_iff` becomes
unprovable, and with it the acceptance table of the tabulation, obligation O2.**

`accOf_iff` is the one bridge still hostage to it. The two sampler runs of the tabulation are
budgeted from `MIPRE.GapCompression.sampler_time`, a bound at *every* index carrying no
hypothesis, so `MIPRE.Halting.dimOf_eq` and `MIPRE.Halting.margOf_eq` hold at `n = 0` and
`n = 1` as well and appeal neither to `IsBounded` nor to this lemma. The decider cannot be
budgeted that way — the one a string denotes is the string's own, wrapped, and only
`IsBounded n` bounds it — so `accOf_iff` runs at the budget `n ^ n` that boundedness supplies,
needs `2 ≤ n` to have it, and carries `MIPRE.Halting.acc_mem_iff`, `tab_match` and `tab_value`
with it. -/
