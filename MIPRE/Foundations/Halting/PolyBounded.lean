# Polynomially bounded functions

The time accounting of the instantiation (`Halting/Wrapper.lean`, `Halting/Compressor.lean`)
composes a dozen explicit cost bounds, each a polynomial in the values it depends on. What the
argument eventually needs is only that the total is bounded by *some* polynomial in the level,
so that it falls under `2 ^ n` above a threshold. `PolyBounded f` records exactly that —
`f n ≤ P.eval n` for some `P : Polynomial ℕ` — with the closure properties that let the
bounds be composed without ever writing the polynomial down:

* constants, the identity, sums, products, powers, `Nat.size`;
* `PolyBounded.comp`: a polynomially bounded function of a polynomially bounded function;
* `PolyBounded.eval`: a fixed polynomial evaluated at a polynomially bounded argument;
* `PolyBounded.mono`: domination by a polynomially bounded function;
* `PolyBounded.exists_le_two_pow`: the threshold, `f n ≤ 2 ^ n` for all `n` above some `n₀`;
  `PolyBounded.exists_le_pow`: a single `λ` with `f n ≤ n ^ λ` for *every* `n ≥ 2`, which is the
  shape `Verifier.IsBounded` asks for.

`PolyCost` and `HasPolyCost` are the same notion for the cost of a program at index `n` on an
input `d`: bounded by `C n · (|d| + 1) ^ k` with `C` polynomially bounded and `k` constant —
exactly what `Decider.TimeBoundAt` asks for, and what the stages of a decider's run compose
into (`PolyCost.add`, `mul`, `poly`, the last being the universal machine's overhead).

The polynomial of a `PolyBounded` function can be extracted (`PolyBounded.choose`) where an
explicit `Polynomial ℕ` is required, as in the `timeBound` field of `PolyTimeFun`.
