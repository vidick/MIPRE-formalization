# Parallel repetition of normal form verifiers, as a hypothesis

Blueprint `thm:parallel-repetition` (paper `parallel_amplification.tex`, `thm:repetition`, in
its direct rather than anchored form; ledger nodes `1.4`, `1.4.3`, `1.4.3.1`), stated as the
data the theorem provides: the structure `Repetition ℓ`. Its inhabitation is the theorem: the
game-level direct repetition theorem `thm:direct-repetition-q`
(`MIPRE.Repetition.quantumValue_repeat_le`, vendored) packaged at the level of verifiers — a
sampler running `k(n)` independent copies of the input sampler, a decider parsing a
self-delimiting `k(n)`-tuple of answers and running the input decider on every coordinate.
Nothing here proves it. The composition `MIPRE.GapCompression.ofPipeline` consumes an
instance at `ℓ = 7`.

The reading of the paper's statement in the vocabulary of `MIPRE.Verifier`:

* `ComputeParrepVerifier` takes `(𝒱, ℓ, λ, τ)`; the number of repetitions is
  `k(n) = (λn)^τ`, read as `2^{τ(|λ| + |n|)}` with `|·|` the bit length — the power of two just
  above `(λn)^τ` (`Nat.size`), which a program of the ambient model writes down by a walk over
  the bits of `λ` and `n`, where the paper's expression would need multiplication. The repeated
  decider parses each coordinate of an answer against a length `2^{β(|λ| + |n|)}` — the paper's
  `B_𝒟(n)`, read from the timeout-counter form of the decider there, and a further parameter
  `β` here — so the procedure is a polynomial-time function of the input programs and
  `(λ, τ, β)` (`compute`); the repeated sampler depends only on the input sampler and `(λ, τ)`
  (`sampler`).
* The complexity clause bounds the output at index `n` by a polynomial in `k(n)`, the parse
  length, the input's budget at `n` and the input's description length (the paper's
  `poly(k(n), TIME_𝒮(n))` and `poly(k(n), B_𝒟(n))`), at a degree affine in the input's — the
  repeated decider runs the input decider through the universal machine, whose overhead is
  polynomial — and the answers it accepts by a polynomial in `k(n)` and the parse length alone.
* Completeness: a value-`1` PCC strategy for `𝒱_n` gives one for `𝒱^rep_n`.
* Soundness: `val*(𝒱_n) ≤ 1 - ε` gives `val*(𝒱^rep_n) ≤ exp(-c ε^13 k(n) / (B + 1))`, with
  `B = 2^{β(|λ| + |n|)}` the parse length: `thm:direct-repetition-q` with `log(|𝒜||ℬ|) ≤ 2(B + 1)`
  for answer alphabets of strings of length at most `B`, the constant `c` absorbing the
  factor `3`. The exponent `13` is the vendored theorem's.

Answer alphabets: `𝒱_n` is read with answers of length at most the parse length, so that the
repeated game is exactly the direct repetition of `𝒱_n` at that alphabet, and `𝒱^rep_n` with
answers of length at most its own bound, beyond which its decider rejects.
