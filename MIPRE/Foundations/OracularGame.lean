# Oracularization, at the level of games

Blueprint `thm:oracularization` (paper `oracularization.tex`, `sec:orac-def` and
`fig:oracle-decider`) turns a normal form verifier into one where a single player --- the
*oracle* --- receives the sampler's whole seed and answers *both* original questions, while the
other player receives one of the two questions and must answer consistently. That makes the
predicate a pointwise function of one player's answer, which is the format answer reduction
needs.

This file is the construction and its question distribution, at the level of games: no
samplers, no deciders, no types-as-Turing-machine-strings. What oracularization uses of a
sampler is only the pair of maps `L^𝖠, L^𝖡` on the seed space, so the input here is a
`SeededGame`: a finite seed space, two question maps, and a decision predicate. The original
game is the law of `(L^𝖠 z, L^𝖡 z)` for a uniform seed, the paper's CL distribution
(`MIPRE.CL.clDist` is the same thing for `V = 𝔽^ι`).

The output `SeededGame.oracular` is a `SynchronousGame` on questions `Role × V` and answers
`OAns A`, and its synchronicity is not an extra hypothesis: equal questions have equal roles,
and check 2(a) of `fig:oracle-decider` rejects unequal answers there.

## Scope, and what this file does not do

Two of the four repairs `rem:oracularization-repairs` records are about the *verifier*, not the
game, and are untouched here: grouping the decider's failed bounded parses into one
distinguished outcome (so the oracle families are projective measurements rather than
sub-measurements), and the truncation of answers to `B_𝒟(n)`. At a finite game-level answer
alphabet there is no parse to fail, so there is nothing to group; saying so is more honest than
claiming the repair is discharged. What *is* modelled is the shape check: an answer whose shape
does not match the player's role is rejected (`shapeOk`), which is the game-level residue of
the parse.

Completeness --- a value-`1` PCC strategy for the input gives one for the output, with
*identical measurement operators* rather than a symmetric state, which is repair 2 --- and
soundness, with its single square root, are separate pieces.
